      "# Experimental Setup\n",
      "The first step in building our machine learning autocoder is to gather previously coded data. In this class we will use the MSHA data we have worked with previously, but any coded data can be used. \n",
      "\n",
      "We will use this data for 3 major purposes which we call training, validation, and testing. The first we will do is randomly divided our data into 3 separate datasets, one for each of these purposes. The training data will be used to train a variety of different autocoders, the validation data will be used to determine which of these is best, and the test data will be used (ideally, only once) at the very end to measure how well our best autocoder works.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's important to do this because the techniques we will be using have a tremendous ability to learn; so much so that they run the risk of simply memorizing patterns that occur without learning broader generalizations that are likely to occur again in the future. For example, our algorithm might notice that the one time the name \"Wiatt Springfield\" appeared in our training data it was associated with a \"foot\" injury. As a result, it may think that any other narrative which contains these words should be coded as foot injury. This phenomenon is called \"overfitting\" and it is the bane of many an autocoder. If we were to evaluate our autocoder on the same data it was trained on, we would not be able to detect these problems.\n",
      "\n",
      "The justification for separate validation and test data sets is a little more subtle. In machine learning, we often evaluate a huge number of possible autocoders. It is not uncommon to try hundreds or thousands of potential configurations of a machine learning algorithm. Evaluating against the validation data allows us to choose which of these is best, however it does not necessarily give us an accurate estimate of how well this autocoder will perform on unseen data, as our generation of large numbers of models runs the risk of overfitting the validation data. This is what the test data is for, and ideally we use it only once, so we know how well we're doing.\n",
      "\n",
      "The exact ratio of cases allocated to the training, validation, and test datasets is usually not too important, a 50%/25%/25% split is not unusual, nor is a 90%/5%/5% split. Ultimately, the tradeoff is that more training data allows us to build better initial models, more validation data allows us to more precisely determine the best of our competing models, and more test data allows us to more precisely measure the quality of our final model.
